🔒 IoT Data Security & Ethics: ML/DL Activity Recognition
Project Brief
This project explores the critical security and ethical challenges posed by massive data collection from Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., Strava/wearables). We use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (FFNN) models to demonstrate the high utility of this data for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and, consequently, the immense risk of misuse by surveillance actors.

The final deliverable includes a comparative performance analysis and a practical demonstration of cryptographic security measures applied directly to the trained AI assets.

🚀 Key Objectives & Findings
Objective	Proof Point	Security/Ethical Implication
Model Comparison	DL (FFNN) achieved significantly higher F1-Scores than the ML baseline.	High Value: Confirms the data's utility for detailed profiling and surveillance.
Ethical Analysis	Quantifiable 0.00 F1-Score on minority classes (e.g., 'Workout').	Algorithmic Bias: Proves the ethical failure of centralized, imbalanced data collection.
Asset Defense	Successful demonstration of Integrity Checks and AES Encryption on the final model files.	Necessity: Demonstrates the practical defenses required to protect the high-value 'black-box' AI asset from tampering.
🛠️ Setup and Installation
1. Environment Setup (Recommended)

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv) to isolate project dependencies.

Bash
# 1. Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
2. Dependency Installation

The project requires core data science libraries, TensorFlow for Deep Learning, and specialized libraries for cryptographic security (pyzipper, cryptography).

Install all necessary packages in one command:

Bash
# Install core ML/DL, Preprocessing, and Security Libraries
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow joblib matplotlib seaborn pyzipper cryptography getpass

🏃 Execution Guide
To replicate the security demonstration and model training:

Ensure data is ready: Make sure your final, clean CSV (strava_processed_data.csv) is generated by the preprocessing script.

Run the Main DL Script: This script handles model training, integrity checking, encryption, and final evaluation.

Bash
python scripts/02_model_training_dl.py
Expected Output Log Flow

The log will show the successful training metrics followed by the security workflow:

Training Metrics (Accuracy/F1-Score)

✅ INTEGRITY CHECK: strava_activity_classify.keras is UNMODIFIED (Hash Match).

User is prompted to enter secure key.

✅ CRYPTOGRAPHY APPLIED: Model encrypted and stored as [file.enc]. Plaintext removed.

✅ DECRYPTION SUCCESSFUL: Model extracted for loading.

✅ INTEGRITY CHECK: strava_activity_classify.keras is UNMODIFIED (Hash Match).

✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS: All three model components loaded successfully after security checks.
